            <h2>Milly</h2> <hr/>
            <p>
                Customizable, efficient, usable collector 
                of thoughts, ideas, and inspiration.
                <br><br>
                I used Milly to develop Milly. It's great for quickly
                recording your ideas, then arranging them in
                whatever way makes sense to you.
                <br><br>
                Just type your thoughts and hit enter, 
                and they immediately get added to your list of entries,
                along with the exact date and time you submitted them.  
                <br><br>
                Save and load your files. Rearrange and edit your lists.
                Arrange your entries into groups.
                Export them to csv, txt, and pdf.
                Use the Find feature to search your collected thoughts.
                <br><br>
                Extensive Settings options: 
                you can write and save your own color schemes,
                select from hundreds of fonts,
                and hide whichever parts of the entry functionality you don't need.
                <br><br>
                Lots of convenient keyboard shortcuts, so you can brainstorm
                at a breakneck pace.

                You're on it. I type everything out in HTML, 
                and trick it out with CSS and Javascript.
