                Collector of thoughts, ideas, and inspiration. 
                Quickly record your ideas, then arrange them in
                whatever way makes sense to you.
                <br><br>
                Just type your thoughts and hit enter, 
                and they immediately get added to your list of entries,
                along with the exact date and time you submitted them.  
                <br><br>
                Save and load files. Arrange and group entries.
                Export to csv and txt. 
                Use the Find feature to search your collected thoughts.
                <br><br>
                Write and save your own color schemes,
                select from hundreds of fonts,
                and hide whichever parts of the entry functionality you don't need.
