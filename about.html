        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am an artist and engineer from Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
        <p>I like to create, explore, and arrange interesting sounds, sights, words, and toys.</p>
        <p>I don't go on social media anymore, so you won't find me there.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get in touch, go <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
