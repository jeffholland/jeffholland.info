    <div class="poem">
        <p>When now ends, isn't it always?</p>
        <p>Cut from a different ribbon,</p>
        <p>taut like an envious membrane,</p>
        <p>pierced only by timeless silence,</p>
        <p>I know not but yielding.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Tremors demand precision.</p>
        <p>This whole reprisal ain't but</p>
        <p>one big steaming heap of feel-good mumbo-jumbo.</p>
        <p>Shrill nocturnal devils recommence gnawing,</p>
        <p>damned if you do. Don't.</p>
        <br/>   
        <p>But red sounds haunt me here, and</p>
        <p>wasn't it you who crapped in the manger?</p>
        <p>I can't bear the blank riddle,</p>
        <p>nor bury the black puddle,</p>
        <p>so it'll be the deluge 'till the curse comes curdling home.</p>
        <br/>  
        <p>Atonal orange lambs keep blowing up my battery.</p>
        <p>I'm worse, though.</p>
        <p>Atolls won't withstand typhoons.</p>
