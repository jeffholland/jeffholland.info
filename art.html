                <p>My artistic medium involves a process called <strong>data-bending</strong>.</p>
                <p>I manipulate images by converting them to raw data, running various processes on them, and then converting them back into images. 
                    These processes manipulate the colors and textures of the image to create something entirely new.</p>
